Study notes for AWS SAP-C02, assisted by Claude.

## What's this

Going through Stephane Maarek's Udemy course. Instead of taking notes by hand, I use Claude Code to:

- Extract video transcripts
- Break down concepts step by step
- Quiz me after each lesson
- Track progress

## Structure

```
/transcripts/          # Notes by section
  /3-Identity/         # IAM, STS, Cognito, Organizations...
  /4-Security/         # CloudTrail, KMS, WAF...
/progress/             # Quiz results + XP
STUDY_PLAN.md          # 205 lessons, 19 sections
```
