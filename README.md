## What's this

Studying for AWS SAP-C02 using [Stephane Maarek's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/). Instead of falling asleep watching videos, I'm using Claude Code as my study buddy.

**How it works:**
1. I feed video transcripts to Claude
2. Claude breaks down concepts with ASCII diagrams and real-world analogies
3. I ask "dumb" questions until it actually makes sense
4. Quiz time (4 questions per lesson, no mercy)
5. Track progress and move on

The goal isn't just to pass, it's to actually understand services I've never used professionally (CloudHSM, Macie, and stuff like that).
